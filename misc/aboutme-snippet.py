        Hey, I'm Dev Patel, a 18-year-old Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. 
    In my Bachelors of Science program, I'm focused on coding, problem-solving, and keeping up with 
    tech trends. As I tackle coursework and coding challenges, I'm particularly interested in artificial 
    intelligence and machine learning. Looking ahead, I'm leaning towards exploring opportunities in BioTech 
    or FinTech after graduation, where I hope to apply my skills to make a real-world impact.
